This repository contains replication code for analyses related to parental and adolescent health behaviors and pathways to adulthood. The results are reported in a manuscript that is currently under review. The analysis draws on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Information about obtaining the data is available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth. The results of this analysis are reported in Bauldry et al. (2016).

## Files
1. pta-data-3.do: Stata do file that prepares the data for analysis.
2. pta-descriptives-3.do: Stata do file that produces descriptive statistics.
3. pta-con-extract-3.do: Stata do file that reads Mplus output for conditional latent class models.
4. pta-con-results-3.do: Stata do file that prepares information for tables and figures from the conditional latent class models.
5. pta-con-prd-prb-3.do: Stata do file that computes predicted probabilities based on the conditional latent class models.
6. pta-con-#.inp: Mplus input files that specify conditional latent class models allowing for 1 to 7 pathways.
7. pta-unc-#.inp: Mplus input files that specify unconditional latent class models allowing for 1 to 7 pathways.
